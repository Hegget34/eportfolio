## Welcome to My ePortfolio

Welcome to my professional ePortfolio showcasing my growth and achievements throughout the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University. This portfolio demonstrates my skills in software engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management through three enhanced artifacts that illustrate my ability to write secure, efficient, and maintainable code.

## Professional Self-Assessment

[Read my complete professional self-assessment](./professional-self-assessment.md) to learn about my journey through the Computer Science program, the skills I have developed, and how I am prepared to contribute as a professional software developer.

**Key Highlights:**
- Demonstrated ability to transform poorly structured code into professional-quality software
- Proven expertise in identifying and fixing critical security vulnerabilities
- Strong understanding of algorithmic efficiency with measurable performance improvements
- Experience working in collaborative team environments with effective communication skills

## Code Review

**[Watch my Code Review Video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/cm1HGNd9Gls)**

In this 30-minute code review, I analyze three artifacts from my coursework, identify areas for improvement, and explain my enhancement plans. The review covers:

- **Existing functionality:** Walkthrough of original code features
- **Code analysis:** Identification of issues in structure, security, efficiency, and documentation
- **Enhancement plans:** Detailed explanation of planned improvements aligned with course outcomes

The code review demonstrates my ability to:
- Critically analyze existing code
- Identify security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks
- Communicate technical concepts clearly
- Plan systematic improvements

## Enhanced Artifacts

### 1. Software Design & Engineering: Task Management Application

**Original:** Basic command-line task manager from CS 320 with global variables, no error handling, and no data persistence

**Enhanced:** Professional object-oriented application with comprehensive error handling, JSON persistence, and input validation

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Refactored from procedural to OOP design (Task and TaskManager classes)
- ✅ Added comprehensive try-except error handling
- ✅ Implemented JSON file persistence for data storage
- ✅ Added input validation preventing crashes
- ✅ Professional documentation with docstrings and type hints

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Object-oriented design and encapsulation
- Defensive programming and error handling
- Data persistence implementation
- Code organization following DRY principle

**Course Outcomes:** 3, 4, 5

### 2. Algorithms & Data Structures: Student Records Management System

**Original:** Student records system from CS 260 with O(n²) bubble sort and O(n) linear search

**Enhanced:** High-performance system with O(n log n) sorting and O(1) hash table lookups

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Replaced bubble sort with Timsort: **1,000x faster** for 10,000 students
- ✅ Converted list to hash table dictionary: **10,000x faster** ID searches
- ✅ Implemented heap algorithm for top-N selection
- ✅ Added performance benchmarking and timing
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation with error messages

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Computational complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Data structure selection (hash tables vs. lists)
- Algorithm optimization with measurable results
- Performance benchmarking

**Course Outcomes:** 2, 3, 4

### 3. Databases: Inventory Management System

**Original:** Inventory system from CS 340 with **7 SQL injection vulnerabilities**, no constraints, and no indexes

**Enhanced:** Secure, optimized database application with parameterized queries, constraints, and performance indexes

**Key Improvements:**
- 🔒 **CRITICAL:** Fixed all 7 SQL injection vulnerabilities with parameterized queries
- ✅ Added foreign keys, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints
- ✅ Created performance indexes: **100-1,000x faster** queries
- ✅ Optimized queries using SQL aggregation instead of Python loops
- ✅ Implemented transaction management with automatic rollback
- ✅ Moved credentials to environment variables

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- SQL injection prevention (OWASP Top 10)
- Database schema design with constraints
- Query optimization and indexing
- Transaction management and error handling
- Security-first development approach

**Course Outcomes:** 2, 4, 5
